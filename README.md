## Announcement

I'm closing down this project since nexus511 has done an excellent job on creating an alternative (which I will likely use!)

For anyone not wishing to use Ubuntu - I do intend to document all of the steps this ansible playbook performed and I will not remove the source code for this project so feel free to use it.

I will, however, disable issue reporting since I will not be working on those.

Thank you for understanding!
